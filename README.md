The Berkeley Out-of-Order RISC-V Processor [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/riscv-boom/riscv-boom.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/riscv-boom/riscv-boom)
====================================================================================================================================================================

The Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM) is a synthesizable and parameterizable open source RV64GC RISC-V core written in the [Chisel](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/) hardware construction language.
Created at the University of California,
Berkeley in the [Berkeley Architecture Research](https://bar.eecs.berkeley.edu/) group, its focus is to create a high performance, synthesizable, and parameterizable core for architecture research.
The current version of the BOOM microarchitecture ([SonicBOOM, or BOOMv3](https://carrv.github.io/2020/papers/CARRV2020_paper_15_Zhao.pdf)) is performance competitive with commercial high-performance out-of-order cores, achieving 6.2 CoreMarks/MHz.

## IMPORTANT: Using BOOM
This repository is **NOT A SELF-RUNNING** repository. To instantiate a BOOM core, please use the
[Chipyard](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard) SoC generator.

The current hash of Chipyard that works with this repository is located in the `CHIPYARD.hash`
file in the top level directory of this repository. This file is mainly used for CI purposes, since
Chipyard should follow the correct version of rocket-chip. For most users, you should be able to
clone Chipyard separately and follow the default Chipyard instructions (without having to use the `.hash` file).

While BOOM is primarily ASIC-optimized, it is also usable on FPGAs.
Chipyard provides infrastructure and documentation for deploying BOOM on AWS F1 FPGAs through FireSim.
