These are the scripts that Travis CI uses to run the tests during a PR.

Note: This uses the most up to date version of riscv-boom/boom-template to run the tests

Things to look into:
--------------------
- Sometime during the clone of riscv-tools there is a timeout for cloning gcc. This is because
during the clone step, there is no output to the screen for over 10mins. This causes Travis to 
error out and not finish the build

- This does not test changes across multiple sub-modules of boom-template. For ex, if rocket-chip
also needs to be updated, then this will not reflect those changes unless boom-template has those
changes already put in.
