\chapter{The Decode Stage}

The decode stage takes instructions from the fetch buffer, decodes them, and allocates the necessary resources as required by each instruction.  The decode stage will stall as needed if not all resources are available.

%\section{The Decode Table}

%I think it would be neat to discuss how the decoder is essentially generated from a table, I don't know exactly how this works but it's honestly pretty neat and most companies are moving to table-based decoders (in excel normally I think), so this is a huge selling point of Chisel (not of BOOM directly, but it's related). Perhaps this section could be written by someone else

%\section{Parameterization}

%The width of the Decode Stage is parameterizable.  However, the current limitation is the Fetch 
%\TODO{discuss parameterization, and the coupling of fetch width to decode width}.
