              multicore processors, we must allow programmers to
              arbitrarily compose parallel libraries without
              sacrificing performance. We argue that high-level
              task or thread abstractions and a common global
              scheduler cannot provide effective library
              composition. Instead, the operating system should
              expose unvirtualized processing resources that can
              be shared cooperatively between parallel libraries
              within an application. In this paper, we describe
              a system that standardizes and facilitates the
              exchange of these unvirtualized processing
              resources between libraries.},

 @Article{statistical_sampling,
   abstract    = {Current software-based micro architecture simulators are
                 many orders of magnitude slower than the hardware they
                 simulate. Hence, most microarchitecture design studies
                 draw their conclusions from drastically truncated
                 benchmark simulations that are often inaccurate and
                 misleading. This article presents the Sampling
                 Microarchitecture Simulation (SMARTS) framework as an
                 approach to enable fast and accurate performance
                 measurements of full-length benchmarks. SMARTS
                 accelerates simulation by selectively measuring in detail
                 only an appropriate benchmark subset. SMARTS prescribes a
                 statistically sound procedure for configuring a
                 systematic sampling simulation run to achieve a desired
                 quantifiable confidence in estimates. Analysis of the
                 SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite shows that CPI and energy
                 per instruction (EPI) can be estimated to within
                 &plusmn;3% with 99.7% confidence by measuring fewer than
                 50 million instructions per benchmark. In practice,
                 inaccuracy in microarchitectural state initialization
                 introduces an additional uncertainty which we empirically
                 bound to &sim;2% for the tested benchmarks. Our
                 implementation of SMARTS achieves an actual average error
                 of only 0.64% on CPI and 0.59% on EPI for the tested
                 benchmarks, running with average speedups of 35 and 60
                 over detailed simulation of 8-way and 16-way out-of-order
                 processors, respectively. &copy; 2006 ACM.},
