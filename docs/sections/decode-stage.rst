The Decode Stage
================

The Decode stage takes instructions from the Fetch Buffer, decodes them,
and allocates the necessary resources as required by each instruction.
The Decode stage will stall as needed if not all resources are available.

RVC Changes
-----------

RVC decode is performed by expanding RVC instructions using Rocket's
RVCExpander. This does not change normal functionality of the Decode Unit.
