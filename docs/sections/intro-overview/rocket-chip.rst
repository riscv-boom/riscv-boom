Rocket Chip SoC Generator
=========================

    :alt: BOOM Chip

    A single-core "BOOM-chip", with no L2 last-level cache

As BOOM is just a core, an entire SoC infrastructure must be provided.
BOOM was developed to use the open-source `Rocket Chip SoC generator <https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip>`__
The Rocket Chip generator can instantiate a wide range of SoC designs, including cache-coherent
multi-tile designs, cores with and without accelerators, and chips with or without a last-level shared cache.
It comes bundled with a 5-stage in-order core, called Rocket, by default.
BOOM uses the Rocket Chip infrastructure to instantiate it's core/tile complex (tile is a core, L1D/I$, and PTW) instead of a
Rocket tile.

The Rocket Core - a Library of Processor Components!
----------------------------------------------------

From BOOM’s point of view, the Rocket core can be thought of as a
"Library of Processor Components." There are a number of modules created
for Rocket that are also used by BOOM - the functional units, the
caches, the translation look-aside buffers, the page table walker, and
more. Throughout this document you will find references to these
Rocket components and descriptions on how they fit into BOOM.
