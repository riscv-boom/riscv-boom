The Issue Unit
==============

The issue window holds dispatched micro-ops that have not yet executed.
When all of the operands for the micro-op are ready, the issue slot sets
its “request" bit high. The issue select logic then chooses to issue a
slot which is asserting its “request" signal. Once a micro-op is issued,
it is removed from the issue window to make room for more dispatched
instructions.

BOOM uses a “unified" issue window - all instructions of all types
(integer, floating point, memory) are placed into a single issue window.

Speculative Issue
-----------------

Although not yet supported, future designs may choose to speculatively
issue micro-ops for improved performance (e.g., speculating that a load
instruction will hit in the cache and thus issuing dependent micro-ops
assuming the load data will be available in the bypass network). In such
a scenario, the issue window cannot remove speculatively issued
micro-ops until the speculation has been resolved. If a
speculatively-issued micro-op failure occurs, then all issued micro-ops
that fall within the speculated window must be killed and retried from
the issue window. More advanced techniques are also available.

Issue Slot
----------

:numref:`single-issue-slot` shows a single issue slot from the
*Issue Window*. [1]_

Instructions are *dispatched* into the *Issue Window*. From here, they
wait for all of their operands to be ready (“p" stands for *presence*
bit, which marks when an operand is *present* in the register file).

Once ready, the *issue slot* will assert its “request" signal, and wait
to be *issued*.

Issue Select Logic
------------------

.. _single-issue-slot:
.. figure:: /figures/issue_slot.png
    :alt: Single Issue Slot

    A single issue slot from the Issue Window.

Each issue select logic port is a static-priority encoder that picks
that first available micro-op in the issue window. Each port will only
schedule a micro-op that its port can handle (e.g., floating point
micro-ops will only be scheduled onto the port governing the Floating
Point Unit). This creates a cascading priority encoder for ports that
can schedule the same micro-ops as each other.

If a functional unit is unavailable, it de-asserts its available signal
and instructions will not be issued to it (e.g., an un-pipelined
divider).

Un-ordered Issue Window
-----------------------

There are two scheduling policies available in BOOM.

The first is a R10K-style un-ordered issue
window. Dispatching instructions are placed
into the first available issue window slot and remain there until they
are *issued*. This can lead to pathologically poor performance,
particularly in scenarios where unpredictable branches are placed into
the lower priority slots and are unable to be issued until the ROB fills
up and the issue window starts to drain. Because instructions following
branches are only *implicitly* dependent on the branch, there is no
other forcing function that enables the branches to issue earlier,
except the filling of the ROB.

Age-ordered Issue Window
------------------------

The second available policy is an age-ordered issue window. Dispatched
instructions are placed into the bottom of the issue window (at lowest
priority). Every cycle, every instruction is shifted upwards (the issue
window is a “collapsing queue"). Thus, the oldest instructions will have
the highest issue priority. While this increases performance by
scheduling older branches and older loads as soon as possible, it comes
with a potential energy penalty as potentially every issue window slot
is being read and written to on every cycle.

Wake-up
-------

There are two types of wake-up in BOOM - *fast* wakeup and *slow*
wakeup. Because ALU micro-ops can send their write-back data through the
bypass network, issued ALU micro-ops will broadcast their wakeup to the
issue-window as they are issued.

However, floating-point operations, loads, and variable latency
operations are not sent through the bypass network, and instead the
wakeup signal comes from the register file ports during the *write-back*
stage.

   Conceptually, a bus is shown for implementing the driving of the
   signals sent to the *Register Read* Stage. In reality BOOM actually
   uses muxes.
