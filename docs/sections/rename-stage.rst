The Rename Stage
================

The rename stage maps the *ISA* (or *logical*) register specifiers of
each instruction to *physical* register specifiers.

The Purpose of Renaming
-----------------------

*Renaming* is a technique to rename the ISA (or *logical*) register
specifiers in an instruction by mapping them to a new space of
*physical* registers. The goal to *register renaming* is to break the
output- (WAW) and anti-dependences (WAR) between instructions, leaving
only the true dependences (RAW). Said again, but in architectural
terminology, register renaming eliminates write-after-write (WAW) and
write-after-read (WAR) hazards, which are artifacts introduced by a)
only having a limited number of ISA registers to use as specifiers and
b) loops, which by their very nature will use the same register
specifiers on every loop iteration.

The Explicit Renaming Design
----------------------------

BOOM is an “explicit renaming" or “physical register file" out-of-order
core design. A physical register file, containing many more registers
than the ISA dictates, holds both the committed architectural register
state and speculative register state. The rename map tables contain the
information needed to recover the committed state. As instructions are
renamed, their register specifiers are explicitly updated to point to
physical registers located in the physical register file. [1]_

This is in contrast to an “implicit renaming" or “data-in-ROB"
out-of-order core design. The Architectural Register File (ARF) only
holds the committed register state, while the ROB holds the speculative
write-back data. On commit, the ROB transfers the speculative data to
the ARF.  [2]_

The Rename Map Table
--------------------

    The Rename Stage. Logical register specifiers read the map table to get their physical specifier.
    For superscalar rename, any changes to the map tables must be bypassed to dependent instructions. The
    physical source specifiers can then read the Busy Table. The Stale specifier is used to track which physical
    register will be freed when the instruction later commits. P0 in the Physical Register File is always 0.

The Rename Map Table holds the speculative mappings from ISA registers
to physical registers.

Each branch gets its own copy of the rename map table. [3]_ On a branch
mispredict, the map table can be reset instantly from the mispredicting
branch’s copy of the map table.

As the RV64G ISA uses fixed locations of the register specifiers (and no
implicit register specifiers), the map table can be read before the
instruction is decoded!

Resets on Exceptions and Flushes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An additional, optional “Committed Map Table" holds the rename map for
the committed architectural state. If enabled, this allows single-cycle
reset of the pipeline during flushes and exceptions (the current map
table is reset to the committed map table). Otherwise, pipeline flushes
require multiple cycles to “unwind" the ROB to write back in the rename
state at the commit point, one ROB row per cycle.

The Busy Table
--------------

The Busy Table tracks the readiness status of each physical register. If
all physical operands are ready, the instruction will be ready to be
issued.

The Free List
-------------

The free-list tracks the physical registers that are currently un-used
and is used to allocate new physical registers to instructions passing
through the *Rename* stage.

The Free List is implemented as a bit-vector. A priority decoder can
then be used to find the first free register. BOOM uses a cascading
priority decoder to allocate multiple registers per cycle. [4]_

On every branch (or jalr), the rename map tables are snapshotted to
allow single-cycle recovery on a branch misprediction. Likewise, the
Free List also sets aside a new “Allocation List", initialized to zero.
As new physical registers are allocated, the Allocation List for each
branch is updated to track all of the physical registers that have been
allocated after the branch. If a misspeculation occurs, its Allocation
List is added back to the Free List by *OR’ing* the branch’s Allocation
List with the Free List. [5]_

Stale Destination Specifiers
----------------------------

For instructions that will write a register, the map table is read to
get the *stale physical destination specifier* (“stale pdst"). Once the
instruction commits, the *stale pdst* is returned to the free list, as
no future instructions will read it.

   The MIPS R10k:raw-latex:`\cite{mipsr10k}`, Alpha
   21264:raw-latex:`\cite{alpha21264}`, Intel Sandy Bridge, and ARM
   Cortex A15 cores are all example of explicit renaming out-of-order
   cores.

.. [2]
   The Pentium 4 and the ARM Cortex A57 are examples of *implicit
   renaming* designs.

.. [3]
   An alternate design for wider pipelines may prefer to only make up to
   one snapshot per cycle, but this comes with additional complexity to
   deduce the precise mappings for any given instruction within the
   fetch packet.

.. [4]
   A two-wide rename stage could use two priority decoders starting from
   opposite ends.

.. [5]
   Conceptually, branches are often described as “snapshotting" the Free
   List (along with an *OR’ing* with the current Free List at the time
   of the misprediction). However, snapshotting fails to account for
   physical registers that were allocated when the snapshot occurs, then
   become freed, then becomes re-allocated before the branch mispredict
   is detected. In this scenario, the physical register gets leaked, as
   neither the snapshot nor the current Free List know that it had been
   freed. Eventually, the processor slows as it struggles to maintain
   enough inflight physical registers, until finally the machine comes
   to a halt. If this sounds autobiographical because the author may
   have trusted computer architecture lectures, well...
