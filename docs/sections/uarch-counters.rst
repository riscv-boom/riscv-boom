Micro-architectural Event Tracking
==================================

Version 1.9.1 of the RISC-V Privileged Architecture adds support for
Hardware Performance Monitor (HPM) counters. [1]_ The HPM support allows
a nearly infinite number of micro-architectural events to be multiplexed
onto up to 29 physical counters. The privilege access levels can also be
set on a per-counter basis.

.. _uarch-counter-table:

Table: UArch Events

+----------+-----------------------------------+
| Number   | Event                             |
+==========+===================================+
| 1        | Committed Branches                |
+----------+-----------------------------------+
| 2        | Committed Branch Mispredictions   |
+----------+-----------------------------------+
| ...      | and many more (see core.scala)    |
+----------+-----------------------------------+

The available events can be modified in core.scala as desired. [2]_ It
is then up to machine-level software to set the privilege access level
and the *event selectors* for each counter as desired.

.. _enable-uarch-counters:
.. code-block:: c 
    :caption: Enable Micro-arch counters 

    static void mstatus_init()
    {
       // Enable user/supervisor use of perf counters
       write_csr(mucounteren, -1);
       write_csr(mscounteren, -1);

       // set events 1 and 2 to counters 3 and 4.
       write_csr(mhpmevent3, 1);
       write_csr(mhpmevent4, 2);

Reading HPM Counters in Software
--------------------------------

The Code Example :numref:`read-csr` demonstrates how to read the value of
any CSR register from software.

.. _read-csr:
.. code-block:: c
    :caption: Read CSR Register 

    #define read_csr_safe(reg) ({ register long __tmp asm("a0"); \   
            asm volatile ("csrr %0, " #reg : "=r"(__tmp)); \               
            __tmp; })             
    
    long csr_cycle  = read_csr_safe(cycle);
    long csr_instr  = read_csr_safe(instret);
    long csr_hpmc3  = read_csr_safe(hpmcounter3);
    ...
    long csr_hpmc31 = read_csr_safe(hpmcounter31);
      
.. [1]
   Future efforts may add some counters into a memory-mapped access
   region. This will open up the ability to track events that, for
   example, may not be tied to any particular core (like last-level
   cache misses).

.. [2]
   Note: io.events(0) will get mapped to being Event #1 (etc.) from the
   point of view of the RISC-V software.
